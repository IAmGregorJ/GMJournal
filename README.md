This is a simple CRUD program that I created in my basic C# class at the Technological University of Denmark, fall semester 2019.

There is both a console version and a very simple WPF version.

Both versions work with the database file that can be found in the root directory. Database logon credentials need to be updated in the program code before things will work. There's no password for the db file itself, but I had it hosted remotely, so there was security on it.

I'm not presenting this as a peoduct in itself, since this can be done MUCH better. It is rather a showcase for what I have previously worked on, and since it IS a working CRUD, maybe someone will be able to get some inspiration from it.
